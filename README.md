###Visualization Descriptions

####Justin Renneke
Changed the index.html file to display democratic polls and added an id for "line" so the bar graph displays as a thinner navy blue line.


####Thomas Peter Wyrostek
I increased the margins on the "choice" class. I also added padding and a background color for the same class.

####Miranda Reese
Decided to give a little flair to the text and used Courier New as the font, and changed the text color to beige.
